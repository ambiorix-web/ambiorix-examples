## Hello World example

This app starts a server and listens on port 3000 for connections.

The app responds with "Hello World" for requests to the root
URL (/) or **route**.

- Navigate to [localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) on your browser to see that.
- Navigate to [localhost:3000/about](http://localhost:3000/about) to see the about page.

For every other path, it will respond with a **404 Not Found**.
