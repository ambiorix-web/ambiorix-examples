## Using standard R package structure with ambiorix

Run the file [index.R](./index.R) to fire up the app.

> [!CAUTION]
> - In this example, I have commited the [.Renviron](./.Renviron) file. **NEVER** do that! This is just for example purposes and to kind of create a full reprex.
> - I have also used and manipulated a global env var (`.GlobalEnv$members`). Please **NEVER** do this. You should use a database instead.
