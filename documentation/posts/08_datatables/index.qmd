## Run app

1. `cd` into the `08_datatables/` dir:

    ```bash
    cd 08_datatables/
    ```

1. Fire up R:
    
    ```bash
    R
    ```

1. Restore package dependencies:
    
    ```r
    renv::restore()
    ```

    Once done, exit R.
1. `index.R` is the entry point. To start the app, run this on the terminal:
    
    ```bash
    Rscript index.R
    ```

## Explanation

This app starts a server and listens on port 3000 for connections.

At this point, I'm not sure there's anything much to say :)

## Goals

Alright, time to build a ✨[CRUD application backend](../09_goals/index.qmd)✨.
